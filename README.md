# Repo Purpose

Welcome to your community-sourced data science repo! The overarching goal here is to provide anyone interested in learning data science with a wealth of open source, industry-best learning materials and learning tracks.

> This repo is a work in progress. Please check back for updates. @momiji15, @Annu-07, and I are collaborating on the structure for this repo. If you would like to be involved in that process, please file an issue in this repo and we will add you to our Slack channel.  

This repo is motivated by recent incidents. The data science community deserves better, and this repo is an attempt to provide a platform for the excellent learning resources available.

## Course Replacements

Many instructors have admirably [advocated against taking their own DataCamp courses](https://twitter.com/noamross/status/1116667602741485571). Often, these instructors have suggested other ways in which learners can access the same material. The suggested replacements for their courses are listed below:
